# Evolution of the Cyberlimb: From Concept to Reality

The Cyberlimb project, much like the biological systems it emulates, is conceived as an evolving entity. This document outlines the planned developmental phases and key milestones, 
charting the progression from initial conceptual validation to the ultimate vision of fully integrated cybernetic systems. Rather than a static roadmap, this represents the natural 
"evolution" of the Cyberlimb, allowing for adaptive growth, learning, and refinement at each stage.

Our journey begins with core principle validation and systematically advances towards complex, multi-system integration, always guided by our ultimate goal of redefining 
human-machine interaction and capability.
