## Phase 1: Core Concept & Basic Actuation Prototype

This initial phase focuses on validating the fundamental principles of the Cyberlimb's design. The goal is to develop the simplest possible functional prototype that demonstrates the viability of nitinol-based actuation and initial thermal control. Success in this phase will prove the core concept and provide a tangible foundation for future development.

**Key Objectives:**

* **Single Hinge Joint Armature:** Design and fabricate a basic skeletal structure featuring a single, functional hinge joint. This will be minimalistic, prioritizing ease of manufacturing (e.g., 3D printed PLA or simple aluminum) over final strength or weight.
* **Nitinol Actuation Proof-of-Concept:** Integrate a single pair of antagonistic nitinol coils (one flexor, one extensor) onto the hinge joint. The primary aim is to reliably demonstrate controlled flexion and extension of the joint through the nitinol's shape memory effect.
* **Basic Thermal Interaction:** Implement a simplified, potentially external, method for heating and cooling the nitinol coils. This will focus on proving the rapid thermal response needed for actuation, without necessarily integrating the full closed-loop fluidic system internally at this stage.

**Deliverables:**

* CAD models and specifications for the basic single-joint armature.
* Functional demonstration of controlled movement via nitinol actuation.
* Preliminary data on nitinol response times and thermal cycling under basic control.
