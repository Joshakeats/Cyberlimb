### Armature Design: A Simple Jointed Arm (First Pass)

To begin defining the armature, we'll outline the fundamental components and their basic requirements. We'll aim for a functional, yet simplified, arm to start.

1. Overall Goal:

- To establish a lightweight, robust, and articulable skeletal framework for a prosthetic arm, capable of supporting the nitinol musculature, fluidic thermal system, and sensory skin. This initial armature will focus on the primary large-scale movements.

2. Core Components (Line by Line):

- Shoulder Joint:

-  Function: Connects the prosthetic arm to the user's body/socket. Allows broad range of motion.
-  1Degrees of Freedom (DoF): Aim for at least 3 DoF for basic human-like movement:
-  Flexion/Extension (forward/backward swing)
-  Abduction/Adduction (side raising/lowering)
-  Internal/External Rotation (rotation along the upper arm's axis)
-  Mechanism (Initial thought): A spherical or multi-axis gimbal-like joint, allowing the required rotations.
-  Material (Initial thought): Lightweight, high-strength composite (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymer) or aerospace-grade aluminum alloy.
-  Integration: Must provide secure attachment points for nitinol muscle bands originating from the torso/socket, and conduits for the fluidic system.

Upper Arm Segment:

- Function: Connects the shoulder to the elbow. Houses main "muscle" groups.
- Shape: Cylindrical or tapered tubular structure, optimized for strength-to-weight ratio.
- Material (Initial thought): Same as shoulder joint â€“ lightweight composite or aluminum.
- Internal Channels: Must incorporate internal channels or pathways for the fluidic system's micro-conduits ("blood vessels") and the "nerve" communication lines.
- Attachment Points: Clearly defined anchor points (bosses, internal ribs) for the nitinol musculature.
