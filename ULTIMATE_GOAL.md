# The Ultimate Goal: Redefining Cybernetics with Nitinol

The Cyberlimb project is driven by an audacious long-term vision: to fundamentally redefine the field of cybernetics. Our ultimate goal is to pioneer the development of advanced cybernetic systems, primarily leveraging the extraordinary properties of nitinol, that can be seamlessly **utilized across virtually all fields of human endeavor.**

This document outlines the aspirational future of the Cyberlimb, detailing the full scope of its potential, the comprehensive realization of its intricate systems, and the broader applications of its core technologies far beyond prosthetic limbs. It serves as our guiding star, inspiring the continuous innovation and collaborative spirit that will drive this project forward.
