Welcome to the Cyberlimb project! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to this groundbreaking open-source endeavor. 
The Cyberlimb aims to redefine what's possible in advanced prosthetics and biomimetic design, envisioning a future where technology 
seamlessly extends human potential. 

This isn't just about building a limb; it's about crafting a new paradigm for human-machine integration, inspired by the elegance of natural anatomy.

We believe true innovation happens through collaboration, blending diverse perspectives from engineering, biology, art, and beyond. 
This project is a "call to arms, and legs, and all other wiggly bits!" â€“ a playful invitation to join our growing community of dreamers and builders.
